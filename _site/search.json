    "text": "I am a recently graduated Physicist (MSc, University of Trento), with a strong passion for computational physics, complex systems, and machine learning. During my studies, I focused on statistical physics, biophysics and advanced computation, both through the choice of courses and my bachelor’s and master’s theses. I am a founding member of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Since 2019 I’ve been a tutor for the University of Trento. My hobbies include video games and parkour.\n\n\n\nCurriculum Vitae\nComplete CV (pdf)    Old Web Version   \n\nWork Experience\n\nClassroom Tutor  \n\nIn the in-class courses, my task as a tutor was to prepare ad-hoc exercises beforehand and then follow the students in their reasoning by providing hints and guidance toward the solution. In the laboratory courses, our job was to explain the lab experiences to the students and assist them in the data collection and analysis ensuring that they understood the underlying reasoning and scientific approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Info\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitution: University of Trento (Italy)\nI was assigned to the following courses:\n\nSep 2022-Dec 2022: Introductory Physics Laboratory (DII), Mathematical Basis for Cognitive Sciences (CIMEC), Mathematics and Statistics I (CIBIO);\n\nMar 2022-June 2022: Laboratory of Physics I with Matlab (DF), Introductory Physics Laboratory (DICAM);\n\nSep 2021-Dec 2021: Introductory Physics Laboratory (DII);\n\nSep 2020-Dec 2020: Mathematics and Statistics (A3C);\n\nSep 2019-Jan 2020: Calculus I (DICAM), Calculus I (DIPSCO), Quantitative Methods for life-sciences (DIPSCO).\n\nThe underlined courses represent the courses for which I was the only tutor. In all other courses, I was part of a team of 2 to 4 tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStoryteller / Science Communicator  \n\nI’m one of the founding members of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Some of our activities include research on a key topic or an interview with a Professor at the University of Trento to write narratives with the principles of storytelling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Info\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitution: Arditodesìo / University of Trento (Italy)\nDate: 2017-2022\nThe plays were then performed in the course of various editions of Teatro della Meraviglia, EIT RAW Materials 2021, CO.SCIENZA Festival 2019, Focus Days 2019 and Fisicittà 2017. In 2022 we partnered with Caltech for the event “La Terra fatta dagli umani” (Earth made by humans) about the beginning of the Anthropocene. The resulting performances were presented both in Trento and at Caltech.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEducation and Training\n\nMaster’s Degree in Physics  \n\nPath: Statistical Biophysics with a focus on computational methods\nFinal Grade: 110/110\nThesis: Computational Models Of Astrocyte-Neuron Dynamics To Explain The Formation Of Working Memory\nSupervisor: prof. L. Tubiana\n\nThe thesis aimed to explore the characteristics of various effective models for neurons with the purpose of finding an effective representation compatible with a description of memory formation via the coupling between neurons and astrocytes. All the models were implemented in Python from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Info and Relevant Courses\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitution: University of Trento (Italy) Date: 09/2020-03/2023 Relevant Courses:\n\nQuantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning;\nAdvanced Computational Physics;\nExperimental Methods;\nLaboratory of Advanced Electronics (signal processing via FPGA);\nMulti-Scale Methods in Soft Matter Physics;\nStatistical Mechanics and Statistical Field Theory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCyberchallenge.IT  \n\nInstitution: University of Trento (Italy) in partnership with Laboratorio Nazionale di Cybersecurity (CINI) Date: 02/2021-06/2021\nCyberChallenge.IT is a course designed to provide the methodological and practical basis to analyze vulnerabilities and possible attacks and identify the most suitable solutions to prevent them.\n\n\n\n\nBachelor’s Degree in Physics  \n\nThesis: Emergent features: from renormalization group to artificial intelligence\nSupervisor: prof. R. Potestio\n\nThe thesis focussed on a possible explanation behind the efficiency of machine learning models. In particular, the link between Restricted Boltzmann Machines applied to the Ising Model and a renormalization procedure was examined.\n\nAfter graduating, I enrolled in the course “Introduction to Data Science for Physicists” as a listener (March-June 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Info and Relevant Courses\n\n\n\n\n\nInstitution: University of Trento (Italy) Date: 09/2020-03/2023 Final Grade: 94/110 Relevant Courses:\n\nScientific Computing (fka Computer Science)\nIntroduction to Machine Learning (fka Advanced Algorithms);\nLinear Algebra I, Analysis I, II, III, and Complex Analysis;\nPhysics I, II, and III, Analytical Mechanics, Quantum Mechanics;\nPhysics Laboratory I (measures), II (analogue electronics and optics), and III (digital electronics);\nChemistry with Laboratory Sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInnovationcamp Diploma  \n\nInstitution: University of Trento (Italy) in partnership with Samsung Date: 02/2020-04/2023\nThe first month was devoted to a 25h online course about the main topics of Industrial Innovation and a two-day intensive training course I was allowed to attend upon ranking among the best in the online test. The following months were used to develop a project work on a real business case."
