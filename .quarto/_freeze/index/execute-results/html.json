During my studies, I focused on statistical physics, biophysics and advanced computation, both through the choice of courses and my bachelor's and master's theses. I am a founding member of Progetto Apollo, a scientific divulgation group operating at the University of Trento in collaboration with Arditodesìo. Since 2019 I’ve been a tutor for the University of Trento. My hobbies include video games and parkour.\n\n::: \n\n",
